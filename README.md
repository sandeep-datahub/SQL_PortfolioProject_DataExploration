# EDA Project - COVID Data Analysis

# Overview
Utilised data from two separate Tables in order to analyse COVID Death vs Vaccination data available in the public domain till 2021 April. 

During the course of this project, I worked on understanding various metrics likes:
1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths
2. Total Cases vs Population
3. Countries with highest infection rate compared to Population
4. Countries with Highest death count per location
5. Continents with highest death count
6. Total Population vs Vaccinations at a Global Level
7. Gradual increase in vaccination count over the days with the help of:
   1. VIEWS
   2. TEMP TABLES
   3. CTEs
